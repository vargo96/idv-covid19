This repository contains some visualizations for COVID-19 data by University of Oxford which was the group mini project for the subject "Interactive Data Visualization". The group was named "The Python Techies" and the group members were Varun Nandkumar Golani (me), Sanjay Chhataru Gupta ([Github Sanjay](https://github.com/sanjaycg486 "Github Sanjay")) and Lalith Sagar Devagudi ([Github Lalith](https://github.com/lalith0010 "Github Lalith")). The description of folders and files in this repository are as follows:

1. **assignment5_plots**: This is a folder containing .html files (demo interactive plots) for all the tasks. (Note: This is not the final output of the python file, it is just a demo of how the plot for each task looks like. One can interact with these .html files).
2. **Assignment5 - Basic Information Sheet.pdf**: This file contains the basic information regarding data, user and task, visualization techniques, interaction and some basic information regarding the implementation.
3. **Assignment5-ThePythonTechies.mp4**: This is a video file explaining our implemented visualizations.
4. **Assignment5-ThePythonTechies.py**: This is the python code file for all the visualizations.
5. **COVID-19 Concept Paper.pdf**: This file is a concept paper which was created as a design before implementation.

The output of the python code file (i.e. all visualizations) is integrated into a dash application. After running the .py code file, the output can be seen by clicking the dash URL in the python console.
